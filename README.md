## Yahrzeits for Salesforce

Yahrzeits for Salesforce converts dates of people's death between the Hebrew and Gregorian calendars and automatically keeps the Gregorian date of their next Yahrzeit up to date within Salesforce.

Dates of people's passing can be entered as a Gregorian date, a Hebrew date (transliterated) or a Hebrew date in Hebrew.

A fully automated solution. Once installed, yahrzeits update nightly so the Next Yahrzeit date on the Gregorian (western) calendar is always accurate.

Geared to the needs of Jewish communities, synagogues and cemeteries using Salesforce, our solution automates the process of keeping yahrzeits current for the deceased loved ones of their congregation. Instead of requiring synagogue staff to use books or search the web, weâ€™ve made it a fully automated process using REST APIs provided by HebCal.com.
